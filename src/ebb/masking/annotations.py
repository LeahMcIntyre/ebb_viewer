    Args:
        path:
            Pinnacle file path containing annotations.
        size:
            The length of the mask to return.
        labels:
            The artifact labels that are to be marked False in the returned
            boolean.
        fs:
            The sampling rate in Hertz of the data acquisition.
        between:
            The start and stop annotation labels between which labeled
            annotations will be included in the mask.
        kwargs:
            Keyword arguments are passed to openseize's Pinnacle initializer.

    Examples:
        >>> from openseize import demos
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> path = demos.paths.locate('annotations_001.txt')
        >>> fs = 5000
